This experience was not the best demonstration of a streamlined or very efficient process in expediting fast food.

The order I was waiting on took a whooping 15 minutes and was given to someone else without an apology. That being said, I would have rated them with 1 star but I decided to walk in and watch the process.
The customer service was what I would expect given the employees having to deal with the distractions from the crowd of people inquiring about their order.

* Customers can look up at the monitors above the counter to see the process of their order.

The average gluttonous ""starving"" American that eats at McDonald's behaves as though their needs are of paramount importance. It's one of the best examples you can witness of bloated self-entitlement.
McDonald's employees, you are doing a good job and on behalf of the Jerry Springer audience members that eat at your restaurant. Please forgive them.",5 stars

There is one manager here that frequently yells at his employees for no reason at all, IN FRONT OF THE CUSTOMERS! I honestly feel bad that they have to be treated like that because apparently the manager doesn't understand that places get busy and there will be a wait a bit longer than usual. This location always has homeless people standing/sitting at each exit of the parking lot. One hot, summer day, I was leaving this McDonald's and made the mistake of putting down my windows down before leaving the parking lot. I was stopped by one homeless man and he asked for money, and usually I don't carry cash, but I happened to have a couple quarters in my car, so I gave them to him and he thanked me for helping him and his brother out. I pulled forward a bit more, and his brother stood up, walked over to my car, and I thought he was just going to thank me for the money, but nope! He literally started climbing inside my car to get some food from the passenger seat. He was grabbing me, and had his hands on my steering wheel and I started driving away to get him to stop after offering him some more quarters so he could buy his own food, and he kept yelling at me saying that he wanted the food I had. In the end, I left being robbed of the few bucks I had in coins in my car, and feeling very much violated. Again, this could have been avoided by having my windows up, but I thought it would be worth including that experience in my review. Really not a bad place, but definitely not the best.",3 stars

I have visited this location many times. When there is no business and its slow the workers just stand around talking like nothing going on. I've tried to place my order many times in hopes that I'd receive my food fast enough to get my food and head to work next door before I have to clock in and start my shift. The management is slow and doesn't help out as I figured they wouldn't. My mother went here as well after dropping my off at work to only experience this as well. Many people have to wait foreverrrrr just to get a simple order. The last time I went I just ordered an ice coffee French vanilla and instead of handing me the ice coffee they placed it besides a counter and made me wait 12 minutes for it. I didn't ask anyone this time because im just feed up with this location. If you want McDonalds DO NOT! and I repeat DO NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION!!! They care more about drivethrew then there customers eating inside or taking it to go!!!!!! I'd rare this place 0 if I could.,1 star

I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate service. I am not sure if it's because my car is quiet or what but its mildly annoying. Never has my sauce order been correct. Never. Even when I pay for it. Even when I ask and confirm at the window.

So I've seen this McDonald's go through a lot of changes. The employees here generally have decent attitudes, there are a few that tend to be rude. The store is also dirty a lot of the time. It's a very busy location, and maybe it's from having a lot of foot traffic, but the floor is usually dirty, the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky, the ketchup area will be out of ketchup, and/or there will be ketchup all over the place, too. The tables tend to be dirty, too, you usually have to clean off your own table. Also they have those light up tables that kids like, and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there, and they won't be eating, and they'll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours. And mind you, these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there. My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights, and I'll have to tell him he can't because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table, is camping there. The employees don't seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours, but buying anything. Sometimes they'll even be sleeping at the table.
The kid's play area is also really crappy. They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace. They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly, or at all. When I was a kid they had a huge playplace, which they took out when they remodeled the store. It even had N64's at one point, along with the playplace. But they took it all out and replaced it with a ""sitting"" place instead of a playplace. It's really awful.
So, all in all, this McDonald's is dirty, has a lot of homeless people that practically live there, and isn't really kid friendly. The food is okay, as long as it's hot food (I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong), and the employees are generally friendly, but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster, meaning that you can tell they don't want to be there. This location needs a lot of work. And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there. There hasn't been a single time I've gone there that there wasn't at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at, with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself. The table is by the front counter, too and you can often times smell the homeless person that's sitting there the whole time you're waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks. It is not kid friendly at all at this store. With the store being in a nicer part of town you'd expect quite a bit more cleanliness.",2 stars

Many of the self-ordering machines do not work, when you use a normal line with a cashier, it's like the employees have never even been to a McDonald's before as they don't even know the menu items (I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal, so it wasn't pasta, or some sandwich that only special locations have).  When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.

First 2 out of my last 3 breakfast orders were wrong. But didn't realize until I got to work. I cannot leave my job to go back.
Then today I got a steak, egg, and cheese bagel. Which was right with the exception of 2 long black hairs in it.
I stopped back on my way home and asked for a manager.
The first manager only asked for a receipt. She then left and got another manager. She was a heavy set black woman. She was the most ignorant, vile person that I've ever dealt with. Not even an apology. Her response was to bring it back? 5 hours later? When I said that was ridiculous, she closed the window and walked away. I asked for a corporate phone number and she refused.
I called and I can only assume it was the same ignorant woman because she put the phone down and left it off the hook.
I called again for the phone number and she said its on my receipt and hung up.
She is clearly incompetent and doesn't deserve her jib.
Funny thing is I didn't ask for anything free! An I'm sorry may have been enough.
But nothing even close. I would never recommend this dump of a McDonald's nor the clearly racist manager.

The person responsible for this was in the parking lot and informed me that to be considered a McDonald's customer, I would have had to make my fast-food purchase first, and then been given  30 minutes in the parking lot. It's a cold November evening. Fast food sitting in a car would be cold by the time I had returned, so I did things in what seemed like the logical order. $90 later, I was too disgusted to eat.

This is the slowest MCDs restaurant in the world. Staff act like if they were on vacation. You can see in their faces that they hate working here and are just looking forward to the end of their shift. Manager came out after a while and there was no improvement in performance. The automated order system was not working so I waited in line for 10 mins. just to order and pay. From this point it was exactly 27 mins. until my order was ready. All that was was a bottle of water and a mocha coffee. And I had to ask them otherwise it would have been more than half hour.

Nothing has been done, they don't even want to give me a refund they merely offered me a coupon which they never gave me. It has been months since this had happened and there is still no resolution. If I left a McDonald's with ten dollars worth of food they would have me arrested but because I am a customer they are fine with stealing my money and my time. This is a terrible McDonald's and because of this experience I will no longer be going to any McDonald's in the future.",1 star

Now mind you this parking lot is massive for McDonald's. way bigger than what the store needs. so people try to take advantage of McDonald's by parking here and going elsewhere.

For those idiots that are crying about their car getting booted, they were obviously trying to take advantage - even if they were McDonald's customers. There's signs posted all over that are plain as day stating 30 minute parking only otherwise subject to getting booted or towed.  the sign also blatantly says DO NOT LEAVE THESE PREMISES WITHOUT YOUR VEHICLE. so for everyone else crying, try reading the freaking sign. You know those metal signs cost money and they weren't custom made for entertainment or cosmetic purposes. use your brains......

on another note I visited here my first time just now. food was as expected for McDonald's but it's not like a good cook could make that any better. staff was fast, friendly, and effective. And my order was accurate. -.5 a star for closing the lobby at night but once again I don't blame them. There's a lot of crazies out there especially in the midnight and early morning hours.",5 stars

My issue is that no one knew. Not when I placed my order or when I went to pay. Even the guy at the 2nd window didn't know until he tried to get my drink.

So I ask for my money back. The guy asked me for my receipt. For a dollar in the drive thru. I told him the lady didn't give me one. He takes a few minutes and then asks me to pull forward.

""For a dollar?"" I reply. Bc really this is ridiculous. The last time I pulled forward no one ever came! Plus the guy didn't even confirm what I am waiting for - a manager or my dollar?

I finally got my dollar tho.",1 star
